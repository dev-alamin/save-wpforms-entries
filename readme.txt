== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Which form plugins are supported?**
Version 1.0.0 comes with full support for WPForms (Lite & Pro) and Contact Form 7. We are actively working on integrating other popular plugins like Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms, and more in future updates.

**Is the Google Sheets connection secure?**
Absolutely. We use the official Google OAuth 2.0 protocol, which is the industry standard for secure authentication. You grant permission directly to Google, and our plugin securely stores an authorization token. We never see or store your Google password, and you can revoke access at any time.

**Can I export my entries?**
Yes! You can export entries to CSV. We are planning to add support for Excel and PDF exports in a future update.

**Will this plugin slow down my website?**
No. The plugin operates entirely within the WordPress admin area and only runs queries when you are viewing the entries pages. It is built with performance in mind and will not impact your site's front-end speed.

**Is there a Pro version?**
Currently, all the incredible features listed are available in the free version. We may introduce a Pro version in the future with even more advanced capabilities like advanced reporting, additional export formats, and support for more form plugins.
